    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Technically there is no single recipe for a frappé - it means a cold blended drink, like a slushie (the name means 'beaten' in French). In Greece you may be served a sweetened coffee, shaken until frothy and poured over ice cubes; in France it may be coffee, ice cream and ice whizzed together in a blender; and in America it may be coffee blended with milk, sugar and ice, topped with whipped cream. A mocha frappé has a touch of chocolate added, but a frappé may not have any coffee in it at all - fruit juice blended with fruit and ice makes a fruit frappé.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200ml strong coffee, chilled</li>
        <li>50ml whole milk</li>
        <li>1-3 tsp sugar syrup</li>
        <li>ice cubes</li>
        <li>ice cream or whipped cream to serve (optional)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the coffee into a blender with the milk and 2 or 3 handfuls of ice cubes. Add as much sugar syrup as you like, starting with a small amount - you can always stir more in at the end if you'd like it sweeter.</li>
        <li>Blend until the ice is broken into an icy slush and is foamy. Pour into a glass, and add a scoop of ice cream or some whipped cream if you like.</li>
    </ol>
